function [P]=rawgene(P)
% RAWGENE Updates the raw (not normalized) genes based on normalized genes.
%          Only the population members who have not been evaluated
%          are updated.
%
% P=rawgene(P)
%
% Inputs:
% P = population structure
%
% Outputs:
% P = population structure (with raw genes updated)
