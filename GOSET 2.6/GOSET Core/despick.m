% DESPICK  A function to pick and obtain fitness and gene values of a
%          particular non-dominated solution from the Pareto Optimal
%          front. It also plots the Pareto-Optimal front with the chosen
%          solution highlighted. This works only with 2 objective
%          optimization.

% [geneval,fit] = despick(bI,f)

% Inputs:
% bI       = Best individuals (For the two objective case,
%            each column is a non-dominated individual(sorted according to 
%            the specified objective).
% f        = Best fitness/fitnesses(Each column is a set of fitness values
%            of the individuals corresponding to bI)
%
% Note:  bI and f can be obtained as outputs from GAOPTIMIZE
%
% Outputs:
% gene_val = The gene parameter values of the chosen non-dominated design
% fit      = The fitness value/values of the chosen non-dominated design
